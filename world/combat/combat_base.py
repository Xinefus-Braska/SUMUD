"""
SUMUD Base combat utilities.

This establishes the basic building blocks for combat:

- `CombatFailure` - exception for combat-specific errors.
- `CombatAction` (and subclasses) - classes encompassing all the working around an action.
  They are initialized from 'action-dicts` - dictionaries with all the relevant data for the
  particular invocation
- `CombatHandler` - base class for running a combat. Exactly how this is used depends on the
  type of combat intended (twitch- or turn-based) so many details of this will be implemented
  in child classes.
