"""
Dungeon system

This creates a procedurally generated dungeon.

The dungone originates in an entrance room with exits that spawn a new dungeon connection every X
minutes. As long as characters go through the same exit within that time, they will all end up in
the same dungeon 'branch', otherwise they will go into separate, un-connected dungeon 'branches'.
They can always go back to the start room, but this will become a one-way exit back.

When moving through the dungeon, a new room is not generated until characters
decided to go in that direction. Each room is tagged with the specific 'instance'
id of that particular branch of dungon. When no characters remain in the branch,
the branch is deleted.

Each room in the dungeon starts with a Tag `not_clear`; while this is set, all exits out
of the room (not the one they came from) is blocked. When whatever problem the room
offers has been solved (such as a puzzle or a battle), the tag is removed and the player(s)
can choose which exit to leave through.
