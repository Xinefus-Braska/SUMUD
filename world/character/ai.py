"""
NPC AI module for EvAdventure (WIP)

This implements a simple state machine for NPCs to follow.

The AIHandler class is stored on the NPC object and is queried by the game loop to determine what
the NPC does next. This leads to the calling of one of the relevant state methods on the NPC, which
is where the actual logic for the NPC's behaviour is implemented. Each state is responsible for
switching to the next state when the conditions are met.

The AIMixin class is a mixin that can be added to any object that needs AI. It provides the `.ai`
reference to the AIHandler and a few basic `ai_*` methods for basic AI behaviour.


Example usage:

```python
from evennia import create_object
from .npc import EvadventureNPC
from .ai import AIMixin

class MyMob(AIMixin, EvadventureNPC):
    pass

mob = create_object(MyMob, key="Goblin", location=room)

mob.ai.set_state("roam")

# tick the ai whenever needed
mob.ai.run()

```
